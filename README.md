# Point Cloud Classification Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models
# Project Overview
This project focuses on the classification of 3D point cloud data using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. Point cloud data is widely used in fields such as augmented reality, computer vision, and robotics to represent the shape or surface of physical objects. We employed the ModelNet40 dataset, which consists of CAD models from 40 categories including commonly encountered objects like chairs, beds, desks, and sofas.

# Objectives
Conduct a comparative study of different machine learning and deep learning models for point cloud classification.
Analyze the performance of each model with varying sample sizes to determine accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness.
Identify the most suitable models for point cloud classification tasks.

# Dataset
ModelNet40 Dataset: Contains CAD models from 40 categories, used to train and test the models.
Sampled objects: Airplane, Bed, Bookshelf, Bottle, Chair, Mantel, Monitor, Sofa, Table, Toilet.
File format: .off (Object File Format).

# Models Used
Random Forest Classifier: Handles high-dimensional data effectively, flattened to 2D.
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): Feedforward artificial neural network with multiple layers of interconnected neurons.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Processes data using Conv2D layers for finding patterns in images.
PointNet: Deep learning architecture specifically designed for unordered point clouds.
Methodology
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Utilized the trimesh library for loading and sampling point cloud data.
Model Training and Testing: Trained models with different sample sizes (512, 1024, and 2048 points) and evaluated their performance.
Visualization: Visualized objects with different sample points and confusion matrices to understand model performance.

# Discussion
Overfitting: Observed with PointNet and CNN models as the sample size increased.
Model Suitability: CNN performed best with smaller sample sizes, while Random Forest showed consistent performance across different sizes.
Techniques for Improvement: Regularization methods and data augmentation were suggested to prevent overfitting.

# Conclusion
The comparative study provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of various models for point cloud classification. The findings are valuable for applications in augmented reality, computer vision, and robotics.
